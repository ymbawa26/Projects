
# Fall 2015 CS151 (Science)
# Project 5
# This module tests the calcSurvival function in elephant.py
# Call it like this:
#    python test_calcSurvival.py
# Because I have seeded the random number generator, the output will be identical every time you run it. You should see:
# Out of 10000 calves, 8444 survive, leading to a survival rate of 0.844. It should be 0.850.
# Out of 10000 juveniles and adults, 9963 survive, leading to a survival rate of 0.996. It should be 0.996.
# Out of 10000 seniors, 2240 survive, leading to a survival rate of 0.224. It should be 0.200.
# If you would like it to change from run to run, then comment out the call to random.seed.
