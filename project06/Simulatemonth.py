# This module tests the simulateMonth function in elephant.py
# Call it like this:
#    python3 test_simulateMonth.py
#
#
#                                                                                                                              
#                                                                                                                                     
# NOTE: The following statistics were calculated in Python2, which seems to have had a slightly different                             
# random number generator. Your results will be close to the following, but will likely not match exactly.                            
#         
#
#
# Because I have seeded the random number generator, the output will be identical every # time you run it. 
# You should see:
# In month 1, out of 7500 adult female elephants, 212 gave birth, leading to a birth rate of 0.0283. It should be 0.0147
# In month 1, out of 2500 adult female elephants who could become pregnant, 151 became pregnant this month, leading to a conception rate of 0.060. It should be 0.066
# In month 2, out of 1332 adult female elephants who could become pregnant, 76 became pregnant this month, leading to a conception rate of 0.057. It should be 0.066
# In an earlier version of my elephant.py, I was using the wrong code to determine births (I had "> 22" instead of ">= 22", as the instructions indicate). The output from that run was this:
# In month 1, out of 7500 adult female elephants, 112 gave birth, leading to a birth rate of 0.0149. It should be 0.0147
# In month 1, out of 2500 adult female elephants who could become pregnant, 151 became pregnant this month, leading to a conception rate of 0.060. It should be 0.066
# In month 2, out of 1272 adult female elephants who could become pregnant, 82 became pregnant this month, leading to a conception rate of 0.064. It should be 0.066
# If you would like it to change from run to run, then comment out the call to random.seed.
