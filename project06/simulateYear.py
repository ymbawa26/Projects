# This module tests the simulateMonth function in elephant.py
# Call it like this:
#    python3 test_simulateYear.py
#
#                                                                                                                              
#                                                                                                                                     
# NOTE: The following statistics were calculated in Python2, which seems to have had a slightly different                             
# random number generator. Your results will be close to the following, but will likely not match exactly.                            
#         
#
#
# Because I have seeded the random number generator, the output will be identical every time you run it. You should see:
# After 1 year of simulation, there are 107 elephants.
# After 2nd year of simulation, there are 118 elephants.
# Before I fixed my bug in simulateMonth, here was my output:
# After 1 year of simulation, there are 107 elephants.
# After 2nd year of simulation, there are 111 elephants.
# If you would like it to change from run to run, then comment out the call to random.seed.
