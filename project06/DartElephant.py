# This module tests the dartElephants function in elephant.py
#
# NOTE: The following statistics were calculated in Python2, which seems to have had a slightly different
# random number generator. Your results will be close to the following, but will likely not match exactly.
#
# Call it like this:
#    python3 test_dartElephants.py
# Because I have seeded the random number generator, the output will be identical every time you run it. You should see:
# Test 1
# Out of 5089 adult female elephants, 2574 are darted, leading to a percentage of 0.506. It should be 0.500
# 
# Test 2
# Out of 5010 adult female elephants, 0 are darted, leading to a percentage of 0.000. It should be 0.000
# 
# Test 3
# Out of 4944 adult female elephants, 4944 are darted, leading to a percentage of 1.000. It should be 1.000
# If you would like it to change from run to run, then comment out the call to random.seed.
