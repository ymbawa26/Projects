# This module tests the calcResults function in elephant.py
# Call it like this:
#    python3 test_calcResults.py
#
#                                                                                                                              
#                                                                                                                                     
# NOTE: The following statistics were calculated in Python2, which seems to have had a slightly different                             
# random number generator. Your results will be close to the following, but will likely not match exactly.                            
#         
#
#
#
# Because I have seeded the random number generator, the output will be identical every time you run it. You should see:
# There are 300 total elephants and it reports 10 were culled
# There are 100 calves, 20 juveniles, 42 adult males, 39 adult females, and 99 seniors
# If you would like it to change from run to run, then comment out the call to random.seed.
